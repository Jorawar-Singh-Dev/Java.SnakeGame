# Snake Game
An attempt at creating the famous snake game from the early era of technology
A personal project and a test of skill in using the visuals and the logic building in java

# Bugs #
01. A possibility of the Game Over screen to appear late on the screen after the snake has been set of game area {The precentage of this happening is still unedr testing}
## 02. A chance for the apple to spawn under the snake's body due to which the player must loop around and get the head to touch the apple in order for it to account towards the score [Now fixed with the help of a do-while loop in the newApple class]
